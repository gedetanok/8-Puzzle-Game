# üß© 8-Puzzle Solver with GUI using BFS & DFS (State-Space Tree)

This is a Python program that solves the classic **8-Puzzle problem** using **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** and **Depth-First Search (DFS)**. It includes a graphical interface built with **Tkinter**, and visualizes the solution path step by step using a slider.

## üìå Features

- Solve 8-Puzzle using **BFS** (optimal) or **DFS** (non-optimal).
- State-space tree built **explicitly** using `Node` objects.
- **Manual implementation of Queue** to reinforce algorithm understanding.
- Interactive GUI with:
  - Puzzle canvas
  - Algorithm selector (BFS / DFS)
  - Step-by-step slider of the solution path
- Pop-up message if no solution is found.

## üß† How it Works

- The puzzle board is represented as a tuple of 9 numbers (0 = empty space).
- The program builds a **state-space tree** by generating all possible valid moves.
- BFS explores level by level, ensuring shortest path.
- DFS explores depth-first with a configurable max depth.
- When the goal state is reached, the path is reconstructed and visualized.

## üõ† Technologies Used

- Python 3
- Tkinter (built-in GUI library)
- NumPy (for grid reshaping)
